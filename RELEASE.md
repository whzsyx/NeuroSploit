# NeuroSploit v3.4.0 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** June 2026
**Codename:** Rust Multi-Model Harness
**License:** MIT

---

## TL;DR

A new **Rust harness** (`neurosploit-rs/`) re-implements the autonomous runtime
as a single, fast binary built on `tokio` + `axum`. It drives a **pool of LLM
models** with concurrency limits, **provider failover**, and **N-model validator
voting** — multiple models must independently agree a finding is real before it
is reported — then serves its own solid web dashboard. It reuses the existing
`agents_md/` library (213 agents) unchanged.

## Highlights

- **`neurosploit-rs/` cargo workspace**: `harness` lib crate + `neurosploit`
  binary. `cargo build --release` → one static-ish binary.
- **Multi-model pool** (`pool.rs`): bounded concurrency + automatic **failover**
  across providers; the same panel is reused as the **validator voting** jury.
- **Pipeline** (`pipeline.rs`): recon → parallel agent exploitation (semaphore
  bounded) → **N-model adversarial vote** → score → report. Streams live
  progress over a channel.
- **11 providers / 31 models** (`models.rs`), all OpenAI-compatible: Anthropic,
  OpenAI, xAI, NVIDIA NIM, DeepSeek, Mistral, Qwen, Groq, Together, OpenRouter,
  Ollama. Models like **Qwen / DeepSeek / Llama** usable directly.
- **Axum web dashboard** (`app/`): multi-model selection panel, live execution
  console, findings, agent browser, embedded HTML report. Single binary serves
  the SPA — no npm/build.
- **CLI**: `neurosploit serve | run <url> | agents | models`, plus `--offline`
  mode to exercise the full pipeline without any API keys.

## Usage

```bash
cd neurosploit-rs && cargo build --release
./target/release/neurosploit serve                 # → http://127.0.0.1:8788
./target/release/neurosploit run https://t.example \
    --model anthropic:claude-opus-4-8 --model openai:gpt-5.1 --vote-n 3
```

# NeuroSploit v3.3.0 — Release Notes

**Release Date:** June 2026
**Codename:** Autonomous MD-Agent Engine
**License:** MIT

---

## TL;DR

NeuroSploit's pentest agent has been **re-modeled into an autonomous,
markdown-driven engine**. You give it a URL; it composes a master prompt from a
curated library of **213 markdown agents** and drives a locally-installed
**agentic CLI backend** (Claude Code / Codex / Grok CLI, or a Claude
subscription) to run the engagement end-to-end — with **Playwright MCP** for
proof-of-execution and a **reinforcement-learning** loop that adapts agent
selection across runs. The old Python orchestration was retired to `legacy/`.

## Highlights

- **New engine `neurosploit_agent/`** + `./neurosploit` terminal launcher.
  Interactive (`./neurosploit`) or one-shot (`./neurosploit run <url>`).
- **213-agent markdown library (`agents_md/`)**: **196 vulnerability
  specialists** (now covering LLM/AI, cloud/K8s, modern API/auth, advanced
  injection, protocol smuggling, logic/crypto/supply-chain) + **17 meta-agents**.
- **Meta-agents for quality**: `recon`, `exploit_validator`,
  `false_positive_filter`, `severity_assessor`, `impact_evaluator`, `reporter`,
  and `rl_feedback` — the pipeline validates and adversarially refutes every
  candidate before it can become a finding.
- **Pluggable agentic CLI backends** with auto-detection: Claude Code, Codex,
  Grok CLI; **subscription mode** via Claude Code login.
- **Playwright MCP** wired in (`.mcp.json`) so agents prove client-side execution
  (XSS/CSTI) and capture DOM/network/screenshots instead of trusting reflection.
- **Reinforcement learning** (`neurosploit_agent/rl.py` + `meta/rl_feedback.md`):
  bounded per-agent weights with per-tech-stack affinity, persisted to
  `data/rl_state.json`.
- **Latest model registry** (`neurosploit_agent/models.py`): Anthropic Claude
  4.x, OpenAI, xAI Grok, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama, and **NVIDIA NIM** (PR #28,
  OpenAI-compatible `integrate.api.nvidia.com`, `nvapi-` keys).
- **Data-driven agent builder** `scripts/build_agents.py` for extending the
  library without boilerplate.

## Breaking changes

- The monolithic `neurosploit.py` orchestrator and Python agent classes moved to
  `legacy/` and are no longer the supported entrypoint. Use `./neurosploit`.
- Primary agent library moved from `prompts/agents/` to `agents_md/` (originals
  preserved; meta/role prompts split into `agents_md/meta/`).

## Upgrade notes

1. Install at least one agentic CLI: Claude Code, Codex, or Grok CLI.
2. `npx` (Node) is required for Playwright MCP.
3. Copy `.env.example` → `.env`; set a provider key (or use Claude subscription).
4. `./neurosploit backends` to confirm detection, then `./neurosploit`.

## Core Engine: 100 Vulnerability Types

The vulnerability engine covers 100 distinct vulnerability types organized in 10 categories with dedicated testers, payloads, AI prompts, and proof-of-execution rules for each.

### Categories & Types

| Category | Types | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Injection** | 12 | SQLi (error, union, blind, time-based), Command Injection, SSTI, NoSQL, LDAP, XPath, Expression Language, HTTP Parameter Pollution |
| **XSS** | 3 | Reflected, Stored (two-phase form+display), DOM-based |
| **Authentication** | 7 | Auth Bypass, JWT Manipulation, Session Fixation, Weak Password, Default Credentials, 2FA Bypass, OAuth Misconfig |
| **Authorization** | 5 | IDOR, BOLA, BFLA, Privilege Escalation, Mass Assignment, Forced Browsing |
| **Client-Side** | 9 | CORS, Clickjacking, Open Redirect, DOM Clobbering, PostMessage, WebSocket Hijack, Prototype Pollution, CSS Injection, Tabnabbing |
| **File Access** | 5 | LFI, RFI, Path Traversal, XXE, File Upload |
| **Request Forgery** | 3 | SSRF, SSRF Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure metadata), CSRF |
| **Infrastructure** | 7 | Security Headers, SSL/TLS, HTTP Methods, Directory Listing, Debug Mode, Exposed Admin, Exposed API Docs, Insecure Cookies |
| **Advanced** | 9 | Race Condition, Business Logic, Rate Limit Bypass, Type Juggling, Timing Attack, Host Header Injection, HTTP Smuggling, Cache Poisoning, CRLF |
| **Data Exposure** | 6 | Sensitive Data, Information Disclosure, API Key Exposure, Source Code Disclosure, Backup Files, Version Disclosure |
| **Cloud & Supply Chain** | 6 | S3 Misconfig, Cloud Metadata, Subdomain Takeover, Vulnerable Dependency, Container Escape, Serverless Misconfig |

### Injection Routing

Every vulnerability type is routed to the correct injection point:

- **Parameter injection** (default): SQLi, XSS, IDOR, SSRF, etc.
- **Header injection**: CRLF, Host Header, HTTP Smuggling
- **Body injection**: XXE
- **Path injection**: Path Traversal, LFI
- **Both (param + path)**: LFI, directory traversal variants

### XSS Pipeline (Reflected)

The reflected XSS engine is a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Canary probe** — unique marker per endpoint+param to detect reflection
2. **Context analysis** — 8 contexts: html_body, attribute_value, script_string, script_block, html_comment, url_context, style_context, event_handler
3. **Filter detection** — batch probe to map allowed/blocked chars, tags, events
4. **AI payload generation** — LLM generates context-aware bypass payloads
5. **Escalation payloads** — WAF/encoding bypass variants
6. **Testing** — up to 30 payloads per param with per-payload dedup
7. **Browser validation** — Playwright popup/cookie/DOM/event verification (optional)

### POST Form Support

- HTML forms detected during recon with method, action, all input fields (including `<select>`, `<textarea>`, hidden fields)
- POST form testing includes **all form fields** (CSRF tokens, hidden inputs) — not just the parameter under test
- Redirect following for POST responses (search forms that redirect to results)
- Full HTTP method support: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD

---

## Autonomous Agent Architecture

### 3-Stream Parallel Auto-Pentest

The agent runs 3 concurrent streams via `asyncio.gather()`:

```
Stream 1: Recon          Stream 2: Junior Tester      Stream 3: Tool Runner
  - Crawl target           - Immediate target test       - Nuclei + Naabu
  - Extract forms           - Consume endpoint queue      - AI-selected tools
  - JS analysis             - 3 payloads/endpoint         - Dynamic install
  - Deep fingerprint        - AI-prioritized types        - Process findings
  - Push to queue           - Skip tested types           - Feed back to recon
        |                         |                             |
        +----------+--------------+-----------------------------+
                   |
            Deep Analysis (50-75%)
            Researcher AI (75%)    ← NEW
            Finalization (75-100%)
```

### Reasoning Engine (ReACT)

AI reasoning at strategic checkpoints (50%, 75%):

- **Think**: analyze situation, available data, findings so far
- **Plan**: recommend next actions, prioritize vuln types
- **Reflect**: evaluate results, adjust strategy

Token budget tracking with graceful degradation:
- 0-60% budget: full AI (reasoning + verification + enhancement)
- 60-80%: reduced (skip enhancement)
- 80-95%: minimal (verification only)
- 95%+: technical only (no AI calls)

### Strategy Adaptation

- **Dead endpoint detection**: skip after 5+ consecutive errors
- **Diminishing returns**: reduce testing on low-yield endpoints
- **Priority recomputation**: re-rank vuln types based on results
- **Pattern propagation**: IDOR on `/users/1` automatically queues `/orders/1`, `/accounts/1`
- **Checkpoint refinement**: at 30%/60%/90% refine attack strategy

### Exploit Chaining

10+ chain rules for multi-step attack paths:

- SSRF -> Internal service access -> Data extraction
- SQLi -> Database-specific escalation (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL)
- XSS -> Session hijacking -> Account takeover
- LFI -> Source code disclosure -> Credential extraction
- Auth bypass -> Privilege escalation -> Admin access

AI-driven chain discovery during finalization phase.

## Validation & Anti-Hallucination Pipeline

### 4-Layer Verification

Every finding passes through 4 independent verification layers before confirmation:

```
Finding Signal
    |
    v
[1] Negative Controls  — Send benign/empty probes. Same response = false positive (-60 penalty)
    |
    v
[2] Proof of Execution — Per-vuln-type proof checks (25+ methods). XSS: context analyzer.
    |                      SSRF: metadata markers. SQLi: DB error patterns. Score 0-60.
    v
[3] AI Interpretation  — LLM analyzes with anti-hallucination system prompt + per-type
    |                      proof requirements. Speculative language rejected.
    v
[4] Confidence Scorer  — Numeric 0-100 score. >=90 confirmed, >=60 likely, <60 rejected.
    |
    v
ValidationJudge (sole authority for finding approval)
```

### Anti-Hallucination System Prompts

12 composable anti-hallucination prompt templates injected into all 17 LLM call sites:

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `anti_hallucination` | Core: never claim vuln without concrete proof |
| `anti_scanner` | Don't behave like a scanner — reason like a pentester |
| `negative_controls` | Explain control test methodology |
| `think_like_pentester` | Manual testing mindset |
| `proof_of_execution` | What constitutes real proof per vuln type |
| `frontend_backend_correlation` | Don't confuse client-side vs server-side |
| `multi_phase_tests` | Two-phase testing (submit + verify) |
| `final_judgment` | Conservative final decision framework |
| `confidence_score` | Numeric scoring calibration |
| `anti_severity_inflation` | Don't inflate severity |
| `operational_humility` | Acknowledge uncertainty |
| `access_control_intelligence` | Data comparison, not status code diff |

100 per-vuln-type proof requirements (e.g., SSRF requires metadata content, not just status diff).

### Cross-Validation

- `_cross_validate_ai_claim()` — independent check for XSS, SQLi, SSRF, IDOR, open redirect, CRLF, XXE, NoSQL
- `_evidence_in_response()` — verify AI claim matches actual HTTP response
- Speculative language rejection ("might be", "could be", "possibly")
- Default `False` — findings rejected unless positively proven

### Access Control Intelligence

- BOLA/BFLA/IDOR use **data comparison** methodology (not status code diff)
- JSON field comparison between authenticated user responses
- Adaptive TP/FP learning across scans (9 patterns, 6 known FP patterns)
- Access control types auto-inject specialized prompts

---

## Kali Sandbox & Tool Execution

### Container-Per-Scan Architecture

Each scan gets its own isolated Kali Linux Docker container:

```
ContainerPool (global coordinator)
    |
    +-- Scan A: KaliSandbox (neurosploit-kali-abc123)
    |       +-- nuclei, naabu, httpx (pre-installed)
    |       +-- wpscan (installed on-demand)
    |       +-- sqlmap (installed on-demand)
    |
    +-- Scan B: KaliSandbox (neurosploit-kali-def456)
    |       +-- nuclei, httpx (pre-installed)
    |       +-- dirsearch (installed on-demand)
    |
    +-- max_concurrent, TTL, orphan cleanup
```

### 55 Security Tools

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Pre-installed (Go) | 11 | nuclei, naabu, httpx, subfinder, katana, dnsx, ffuf, gobuster, dalfox, waybackurls, uncover |
| Pre-installed (APT) | 5 | nmap, nikto, sqlmap, masscan, whatweb |
| Pre-installed (System) | 12 | curl, wget, git, python3, pip3, go, jq, dig, whois, openssl, netcat, bash |
| APT on-demand | 15 | wpscan, dirb, hydra, john, hashcat, sslscan, amass, enum4linux, dnsrecon, fierce, crackmapexec |
| Go on-demand | 4 | gau, gitleaks, anew, httprobe |
| Pip on-demand | 8 | dirsearch, wfuzz, arjun, wafw00f, sslyze, commix, trufflehog, retire |

### Dynamic Tool Engine

- AI selects tools based on detected tech stack
- On-demand install → execute → collect results → cleanup
- Tool output parsed and converted to structured findings
- Results fed back into recon context for deeper testing

### Researcher AI Agent

Hypothesis-driven 0-day discovery agent with Kali sandbox access:

```
Observe (recon data + existing findings)
    |
    v
Hypothesize (AI generates targeted hypotheses)
    |          - Logic flaws, race conditions
    v          - CVE-based attacks, misconfigurations
Plan Tools (AI selects from 55+ tools)
    |
    v
Execute in Sandbox (isolated Kali container)
    |
    v
Analyze Results (AI verdicts: confirmed/rejected)
    |
    v
Loop (max 15 hypotheses, 30 tool executions, 5 iterations)
```

Enabled via: `ENABLE_RESEARCHER_AI=true` + per-scan checkbox in frontend.

- Rejected findings section (AI-rejected, pending manual review)
- JSON export for programmatic consumption

### Screenshot Placement

Screenshots are embedded **inline within each vulnerability's PoC section** — directly associated with the finding they evidence. No separate gallery at the end.

```
Vulnerability Finding
  +-- Description
  +-- Proof of Concept
  |     +-- Observation
  |     +-- Hypothesis
  |     +-- Validation (payload + request)
  |     +-- Exploitation Code
  |     +-- Visual Evidence (screenshots)  <-- HERE
  |     +-- Result (impact)
  +-- Remediation
  +-- References
```

---

## Cross-Scan Learning

### Execution History

- `get_priority_types(tech_stack)` — returns types ranked by historical success
- Auto-influences AI prompts and testing priority in future scans
- Bounded storage (500 records, auto-save every 20)

### Access Control Learner

- Adaptive true-positive / false-positive pattern learning
- 9 detection patterns, 6 known FP patterns
- Influences ValidationJudge scoring in subsequent scans

---

docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.kali -t neurosploit-kali:latest docker/
```

### Run

```bash
# Backend (serves frontend static files too)
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Or development mode (frontend hot reload)
cd frontend && npm run dev  # Port 3000
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Python | 3.10+ | 3.12 |
| Node.js | 18+ | 20 LTS |
| Docker | 24+ | Latest (for Kali sandbox) |
| RAM | 4 GB | 8 GB |
| Disk | 2 GB | 5 GB (with Kali image) |

### Backend Dependencies

- **Framework**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy (async), aiosqlite
- **HTTP**: aiohttp
- **LLM**: anthropic, openai
- **Reports**: Jinja2, WeasyPrint
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler
- **Optional**: playwright, docker, mcp

### Frontend Dependencies

- **UI**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State**: Zustand
- **HTTP**: Axios
- **Realtime**: Socket.IO Client
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Build**: Vite

## Known Limitations

- Anthropic API budget limits cause scan interruption — set a fallback provider in `.env`
- Multi-agent orchestration (`ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT`) is experimental
- Playwright browser validation requires Python 3.10+ and Chromium
- MCP server requires Python 3.10+
- Container-per-scan requires Docker daemon running
- Token budget tracking is approximate (estimates, not exact counts)
- CLI report (`neurosploit.py`) does not embed screenshots (backend reports do)
