//! Verification / grounding engine (v3.5.5).
//!
//! Hard rule: **no claim enters the world model without a tool receipt** — raw
//! tool output, not the LLM's paraphrase. This is the empirical anti-hallucination
//! anchor that complements the POMDP belief gate:
//!
//! - **Black-box**: grounding is empirical — the finding's evidence must look
//!   like raw tool output (an HTTP response, an OOB callback, an error oracle),
//!   not prose.
//! - **White-box**: grounding is symbolic — a file:line reference into the
//!   reviewed source (reachability/taint), checked against the collected context.
//!
//! Ungrounded claims are flagged (`receipt_missing`) so the reward layer can
//! penalize them (the "claim without receipt" term).
